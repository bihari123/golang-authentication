# Difference between authentication and authorization
 - Authentication 
   - Determines who you are
   - Verifies that no one is impersonating you
 - Authorization 
   - Says what you are allowed to do 
   - the name of the http header used for authentication

# Http Basic Authentication
 - Basic authentication part of the specification of http
   - send user name and pass with every request
   - uses authentication header annd keyword "basic"
     - put "username:password" together
     - convert them to base64
       - puts generic binary data into printable string
       - base64 is reversible
         - never use it with http, always use https       
  - ex curl -u user:pass    
  - use basic authentication to login screen, from there you can use multi-factor Authentication

# Storing password
 - Never store passwords 
 - Instead store the one way encryption "hash" values of the password
 - earlier bcrypt was the industry standard, but now scrypt is graining traction.
 - for hashing algorithm, the older the better as you know that it has been there for that long without being broken.

 # Bearer Token and HMAC
  - Bearer Token
    - added to the http spec with OAUTH2
    - uses authorization header & keyword "bearer"
    - if you log into any website via google authentication, then on the backend, you are already logged in to google and the server talks to google, gets a bearer token and adds it to the header
  - To prevent faked bearer  tokens, use cryptographic "signing"
    - cryptographic signing is a way to prove that the value was created by a specific person
    - HMAC ( hashed message authentication code)
